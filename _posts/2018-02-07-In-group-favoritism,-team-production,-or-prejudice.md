## In-group favoritism, Team production, and/or Prejudice

오늘은 AEJ AE 페이퍼 두 개를 묶어서 간단히 정리

[Team Production in International Labor Markets: Experimental Evidence from the Field](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160179)

Lyons, Elizabeth. 2017. "Team Production in International Labor Markets: Experimental Evidence from the Field." _American Economic Journal: Applied Economics_, 9 (3): 70--104.

> Coworkers are increasingly diverse in their nationality and skill sets. This paper studies the effect of diversity on how workers are organized using data from a field experiment conducted in an environment where diversity is pervasive. Findings show that team organization improves outcomes when workers are from the same country. The opposite is true when workers are nationally diverse. These results are more pronounced for teams of workers with specialized skills. Further investigation of the data suggests that nationally diverse teams have difficulty communicating.

[The Price of Prejudice](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150241) 

Hedegaard, Morten Størling, and Jean-Robert Tyran. 2018. "The Price of Prejudice." _American Economic Journal: Applied Economics_, 10 (1): 40--63.

> We present a new type of field experiment to investigate ethnic prejudice in the workplace. Our design allows us to study how potential discriminators respond to changes in the cost of discrimination. We find that ethnic discrimination is common but highly responsive to the \"price of prejudice,\" i.e., to the opportunity cost of choosing a less productive worker on ethnic grounds. Discriminators are on average willing to forego 8 percent of their earnings to avoid a coworker of the other ethnic type. The evidence suggests that animus rather than statistical discrimination explains observed behavior.

Team production 페이퍼에서는 international firm에서 같은 나라 출신끼리 한 팀으로 묶인 경우 성과가 더 좋았고, 특별한 기술이 요구되는 팀인 경우 그런 효과가 더욱 두드러졌다는 걸 보고했다.

Prejudice 페이퍼에서는 같은 ethnic grounds를 가진 사람을 고용하기 위해 약 8퍼센트 정도의 생산성을 기회비용으로 날릴 용의가 있다는 것을 확인했다.

두 결과가 상충되는 거는 아니고, 궁금한 거는, 같은 인종을 뽑고 (생산성 &darr;) 팀 프로덕션을 시키면 (생산성 &uarr;) 총 생산성에는 어떤 영향을 미칠까?
