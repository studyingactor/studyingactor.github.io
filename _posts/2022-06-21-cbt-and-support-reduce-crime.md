**Cognitive Behavior Therapy Reduces Crime and Violence over 10 Years: Experimental Evidence**

In most societies, a small number of people commit the most serious violence. Short-term studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can reduce such antisocial behaviors. These behavior changes may be temporary, however, especially from therapy on its own. This is unsettled, however, for there has been little randomized, long-term research. We follow 999 high-risk men in Liberia 10 years after randomization into either: 8 weeks of a therapy; a $200 grant; both; or a control group. A decade later, both therapy alone and therapy with economic assistance produce dramatic reductions in antisocial behaviors. Drug-selling and participation in thefts and robberies, for example, fall by about half. These impacts are greatest among the highest-risk men. The effects of therapy alone, however, are smaller and more fragile. The effects of therapy plus economic assistance are more sustained and precise. Since the cash did not increase earnings for more than a few months, w! e hypothesize that the grant, and the brief legitimate business activity, reinforced the habit formation embodied in CBT. Overall, results suggest that targeted CBT plus economic assistance is an inexpensive and effective way to prevent violence, especially when policymakers are searching for alternatives to aggressive policing and incarceration.

아주 간단한 Randomized experiment인데, 결과가 좋아서 기록용으로 적는다. 999명의 범죄고위험군 남성을 10년간 추적기록한 결과를 확인했다.  네 그룹---(1) 대조군, (2) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 만 8주간 받은 그룹, (3) 200달러 지원 받은 그룹, (4) CBT와 돈을 동시에 받은 그룹---으로 나눈 후에 10년 후에 범죄 감소 효과가 얼마나 큰지 봤는데, (4)가 가장 컸고, (2)는 효과가 있었으나 작았고 fragile했음. (3) 자체는 효과가 없었다는 걸 감안해서, CBT는 교화 효과가 있는데, 초기자본이 있으면 교화된 상태를 유지할 가능성이 훨씬 커진다고 해석했다. 작은 비용과 교육으로 장기 효과를 찾은 좋은 페이퍼다.
